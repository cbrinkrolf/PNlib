# PNlib
Free Modelica library for modelling xHPN.

## Library description
The advanced Petri Net library, called PNlib, enables the modeling of extended hybrid Petri Nets (xHPN). It comprises
 * discrete (PD) and continuous places (PC),
 * discrete (TD), stochastic (TS), and continuous transitions (TC), and
 * test (TA), inhibitor (IA), and read arcs (RA).

The main package PNlib is divided into the following sub-packages:
 * _Interfaces_: contains the connectors of the Petri net component models.
 * _Blocks_: contains blocks with specific procedures that are used in the Petri net component models.
 * _Functions_: contains functions with specific algorithmic procedures which are used in the Petri net component models.
 * _Constants_: contains constants which are used in the Petri net component models.
 * _Examples_: contains several examples and unit tests.
